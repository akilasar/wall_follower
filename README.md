# Lab 3: Wall Following on the Racecar

It's time to use the actual racecar!
You will be taking the wall following code that you ran in simulation and running it on the car.
You will also be building a safety controller to prevent your racecar from crashing into obstacles.

## The Racecar

Plug your router into an outlet and use the ethernet cable to connect it to a working ethernet port (not all the ports in 32-080 work). 
Then connect to the Wi-Fi on your laptop.
The password is ```g0_fast!```.

Check the battery status on your racecar by pressing the power button on your black energizer battery. 
This power button is merely an indicator and does not actually power the battery on or off.
It is always on, so make sure you unplug the power cables when the car is not in use.
On the hokuyo cars the battery sits right on top of the car.
On the velodyne cars the battery is velcroed under the car (be careful when pulling it out).

If your energizer is low on battery, charge it with the adapter.
Note that the car will probably turn off when you disconnect the power adapter; during the switch back to battery power there is a moment where the TX2 does not have enough power to stay on.
You will need to disconnect the car from the power adapter when you want to drive it around.

Connect the two power cables to the energizer battery.
One connects the battery to the lidar and the TX2. 
The other powers the USB hub (which powers the ZED camera and IMU).
If everything is powered, you should see LEDs light up on the TX2 and IMU and you should hear the lidar spinning.

Power on the TX2 by pressing the rightmost button labeled "power".
The button should light up green.
Now you can connect directly to the car using:

    ssh racecar@[COREY_WHAT_IS_THE_IP]
    
The password is ```racecar@mit```.
The car is running ubuntu just like the virtual machine.
It should be familiar but poke around to get comfortable with the structure.
Just like in the simulator, you will often need multiple terminal windows open in order to launch different ros nodes.
There are many ways to do this.

- Open multiple windows on your local machine and ```ssh racecar@[COREY_WHAT_IS_THE_IP]``` in each one of them. You can even ssh from multiple computers at the same time but make sure you are communicating with your team members.
- Use [screen](https://kb.iu.edu/d/acuy) to open layered windows in terminal and navigate through them with key commands.
- Use ```ssh``` with the ```-X``` flag to enable X11 forwarding. With this flag you can launch graphical programs in the ssh client and have them displayed on your local machine. For example you could run ```xterm &``` to get a new terminal window. Or you could run ```i3 &``` to get a tiling window manager. X11 Forwarding can take up more bandwidth so avoid it if your connection is poor.

When you are ready, disconnect the power adapters to the energizer and motors and plug the motors in.
Turn on and recconect to the racecar if necessary.
Get the car to a safe place (_not on a table!_) and launch teleop just like in the simulator:

    roslaunch racecar teleop

Now you should be able to move the car around with the joystick!
Your computer will disconnect from the racecar if it gets too far away from the router, but the code running on it will not be affected.

## Wall Following

Use ```scp``` or ```git clone``` to get one of your team members' wall following code from lab 2 onto the car. 
Get the car into a safe location and make sure ```teleop``` is running. In another terminal launch

    roslaunch wall_follower wall_follower.launch
    
Hopefully this will work without any changes!
If nessesary tune the parameters in the wall follower so that it works well in real life.
Try combining ideas from multiple team members' implimentations of the wall follower to make a more robust controller.

## Safety Controller

Now that youâ€™ve got your wall follower working we want you to build a safety controller.
In future labs the racecar will be moving at high speeds so we need you to build a system that protects it from crashes. 

The racecar has a command mux with different levels of priority.
The navigation mux you have been publishing to has the lowest priority:

    /vesc/ackermann_cmd_mux/input/navigation
    
The joystick has higher priority and commands published to this topic will override commands sent to navigation:

    /vesc/ackermann_cmd_mux/input/teleop
    
The highest priority mux that we have set up is the safety mux:

    /vesc/ackermann_cmd_mux/input/safety
    
Write a node that publishes to the safety mux in order to prevent the racecar from running into obstacles.

We want you to be able to demonstrate that your safety controller is robust. You should be able to use the joystick to attempt to crash the racecar in a variety of senarioes and have the safety controller prevent the crashes (but _please be careful as you are testing_). You should also be able to walk in front of the racecar without it running into you.

But at the same time your racecar should not be "scared". You should still be able to drive close to walls, turn around corners, go fast etc. without the racecar freezing in it's tracks. You will be required to run your safety controller in all future labs so don't cripple yourself with an overprotective safety controller.

## Deliverables

From now on your lab deliverables will consist of two parts; a presentation and a lab report.
Make sure that in each you demonstrate your ability to 

- Log into the physical car and manually drive.
- Autonomously drive the racecar with your wall following code.
- Prevent crashes using your safety controller.

Use of video, screen shots, etc. is highly recommended.
